# 🚀 NovaMind AI Content Pipeline

An end-to-end AI-powered marketing analytics pipeline that automates content generation, audience segmentation, A/B testing, CRM logging, and performance analysis in a single Streamlit application.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Early-stage B2B teams struggle to scale content marketing effectively:

- Content creation is manual and slow  
- Messaging is not tailored to different audience segments  
- A/B testing is inconsistent or missing  
- Performance insights are fragmented and delayed  

---

## 💡 Solution

This project simulates a fully automated growth analytics pipeline that:

- Generates blog content and persona-specific newsletters using AI  
- Segments users into personas (Founder, Operations, Marketing)  
- Assigns A/B variants with different messaging strategies  
- Tracks engagement metrics (open, click, conversion)  
- Analyzes results to identify the best-performing strategy  

---

## 📈 What This Pipeline Produces

Each run generates:

- Campaign-level metrics (open rate, CTR, conversion rate)
- Funnel analysis (sent → opened → clicked → converted)
- A/B comparison across personas and variants
- Automated performance summary and next-step recommendation
